The Notification Service is a scalable, multi-tenant platform that streamlines how applications send and manage notifications across various channels (Email, SMS, Push, etc.). By providing a unified interface and a robust set of APIs, the service handles all essential notification processes such as template management, delivery scheduling, and logging under one roof.

**Key components include:**

<ul>
    <li><b>Multi-Tenancy:</b> Supports both B2C scenarios (single-tenant) and B2B scenarios (multiple Organizations under a single Product).</li>
    <li><b>Secure & Reliable Delivery:</b> Integrates authentication and retry mechanisms to ensure messages reach their intended recipients.</li>
    <li><b>Audit Trails:</b> Maintains detailed records of notifications and events for compliance, troubleshooting, and analytics.</li>
    <li><b>Scalability & Extensibility:</b> Built on a modular architecture, allowing you to add new channels or adapt existing workflows with minimal overhead.</li>
</ul>

## Queue Management at a Glance


<Accordion title="Multiple Queues per Channel"> 
  <li>Each channel (Email, SMS, Push) has its own main queue, retry queue, and dead-letter queue.</li>
  <li>Prevents issues in one channel from impacting others.</li>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Automatic Retries & Dead-Letter Handling">
  <li>Messages that fail are retried behind the scenes (no extra steps for you).</li>
  <li>Persistently failing messages go to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for review/reprocessing.</li>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dashboard Visibility">
  <li>A simple dashboard lets you see how many messages are in each queue (main, retry, DLQ).</li>
  <li>You can quickly identify problems—like a spike in failed messages—and take action.</li>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Separation of Concerns">
  <li>Each queue is dedicated to a single channel; the retry logic and DLQ processes are decoupled from the main flow.</li>
  <li>This design simplifies updates or additions (e.g., adding a new channel).</li>
</Accordion>

    <Steps>
  <Step title="Main Exchange">
    <li>Receives messages for a specific channel (e.g., EmailExchange) and routes them to the Main Queue (e.g., emailQueue).</li>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry Exchange & Queue">
    <li>If a message fails (due to a temporary error), it’s routed to the Retry Exchange (e.g., EmailRetryExchange) and placed in the Retry Queue (e.g., emailRetryQueue).</li>
    <li>After a delay or certain retry logic, the message is re-consumed.</li>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dead-Letter Exchange">
    <li> If a message persists in failing (exceeding maximum retries), it’s routed to the Dead-Letter Exchange (e.g., EmailDLX) and ends up in the Dead-Letter Queue. </li>
    <li> Messages in the Dead-Letter Queue can be manually inspected or reprocessed later.</li>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Benefits
- **Clear Channel Segregation**: Email, SMS, and Push each have distinct flows, preventing cross-channel interference.
- **Resilience**: Automatic retries handle transient failures, while the dead-letter flow prevents stuck messages from blocking the main queue.
- **Visibility**: You can easily see which queues have messages, how many are retrying, and whether any have ended up in the dead-letter queue.
- **Maintainability**: Because each channel’s flow is separate, you can add or modify channels (e.g., a new “WhatsApp” channel) without disrupting the existing setup.
